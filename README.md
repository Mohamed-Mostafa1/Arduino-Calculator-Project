# Arduino Calculator Project

This project is an Arduino-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It's written in C++ using the Arduino IDE and designed to be uploaded to Arduino-compatible boards.

## Features

- Perform basic calculations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- User input via serial monitor or physical interface (e.g., buttons/LCD)
- Result display on serial monitor or LCD
- Error handling (e.g., division by zero)

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- 4x4 Keypad (optional)
- 16x2 LCD display (optional, using I2C or parallel interface)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable for programming

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the `.ino` file.
2. Open the `calculatour.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your Arduino board via USB.
4. Select the correct board and port in **Tools > Board** and **Tools > Port**.
5. Click the **Upload** button to flash the program to your board.

## How to Use

- Open the Serial Monitor from the Arduino IDE (`Ctrl+Shift+M`)
- Follow the on-screen instructions to input two numbers and choose an operation
- The result will be displayed directly

## Example
Enter first number: 12
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
Result: 60
